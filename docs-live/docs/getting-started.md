# Getting started

Quick orientation for new users. Use the pages in this section to:

- Review prerequisites for the hosted API vs. self-hosting.
- Make your first status call against the hosted Vercel deployment.
- Add API keys and webhooks to fan out notifications.

Ready? Start with [Prerequisites](./getting-started/prerequisites.md), then jump to [Making your first API call](./getting-started/making-your-first-api-call.md) and [Adding webhooks](./getting-started/adding-webhooks.md).

If you need to run mc-pulse yourself, skip to [Deploying on your own](./deployment.md).
